If a DB, DBF, or DBOM model was previously recommended, you should reconsider by weighing the importance of the benefits provided by a P3 against the political implications. It may be best to proceed with a traditional Design-Bid-Build. If a DBB is infeasible, and there is too much political risk with a P3, it may be best to delay project procurement.</p>"
